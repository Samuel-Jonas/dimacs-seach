## 9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge - Shortest Paths

<p>
    Shortest path problems are ones of the most fundamental combinatorial optimization problems </br>with many applications, both direct and as subroutines in other combinatorial optimization algorithms. </br>Algorithms for these problems have been studied since 1950's and still remain an active area of research.

## Applying this one in Artificial Intelligence context using agent

### Goal-based agent

Some constraints assumptions for the environment:

1. Static
2. Fully Observable
3. Discrete
4. Deterministic

#### Problem formulation

The agent need to have knowledge to perform the problem and must looks like:

1. Initial condition
2. Actions description (generate conditions)
    - Condition Successor function
    - Operators conjunct
3. The goal test
4. Cost function
5. Seach enveironment between conditions
6. Path
7. Optimal solution
8. Seach tree

### Misinformed seach

1. Breadth first
2. Depth first
3. Uniform cost
4. Limited depth first
5. Interative depth first
